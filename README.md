## M.E.A.N Stack

MEAN is a framework for an easy starting point with [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing MEAN based web apps with useful modules like Mongoose and Passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.



## NOTES

I create this boilerplate because I wanted something easy and fast to start off with. I designed it so that it can be easikty modified and used to bootstrap MEAN stack projects. To use it simply clone the repo, get mongoDB running and edit the config.js file then run the cms node app.js



## Prerequisites
* *MongoDB* - <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/downloads">Download</a> and Install mongodb - <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual">Checkout their manual</a> if you're just starting.
* *Node.js* - <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">Download</a> and Install Node.js, nodeschool has free <a href=" http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers">node tutorials</a> to get you started.

```bash
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

* *Git* - Get git using a package manager or <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">download</a> it.
* Mean currently works with either grunt or gulp..
```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install -g gulp
// and bower
$ npm install -g bower 
```
